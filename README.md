# moodle
moodle (https://moodle.org) is an open source learning management system.<br />
It is possible to import questions from different file formats like XML and gift. But csv format is not in the list.<br />
This little program reads a csv file and converts it to gift format. It is suitable for multi-choice question.<br />
First column of csv file is question name, second is question title, third is correct answer, and other columns are wrong answers.<br />
